README File

This is a maven project. 
I did not have enough time to check if everything is working 100%.

If you select a habitat the graphics does not update until you press the next button and the previous button.
I have not managed to make that the buttons get disabled if there is no more to display.
But I have made the previous button such that it does nothing if its on the first page.
For some reason my page text does not update correctly.
I am aware I should of coded this using java as it would of been quicker for all the sides however I only remembered that halfway through.
Typically I would have cleaned up my code a lot more and comment it more.

How to run the Code:

It should be able to run as a maven project.
The main method is in the App.java file 
Location of File: "/Pokemon-Viewer/src/main/java/Application/Pokemon_Viewer/App.java"
You can open the project in eclipse and right click the App.java file and run as an application.
